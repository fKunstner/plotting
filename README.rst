fplt: A collection of helper functions for matplotlib
================================================================================

`Github repo <https://github.com/fKunstner/plotting>`_

Download to see the docs in ``docs/html/index.html``.

The library can be installed through
``pip install git+https://github.com/fkunstner/plotting.git#egg=fplt``,
but it's my pile of hacks.
It might be more helpful to cherry pick if something looks helpful.
